This is a server developed to run AI competitions. It uses HTTP to pass and receive JSON data.


OBJECTIVE:
-Generic object oriented stateless server/client implemented using JSON passed over HTTP POSTS


TODO:
-Log file out module for the Game
-OOP'ify the ConnectionHandler more
-Benchmark the HTTP Server under high volumes of requests
-Make everything as generic as possible


CLASS INFORMATION:

ServerBootstrap contains the main() for the server part. It is responsible for setting up the HTTP Server and creating the context listener 
as well as initiating the game.

ConnectionHandler gets passed all the HTTP requests and handles them in a logical manner (can pass them to the game).

GameExecutor was implemented as a future development front that could regulate request handling and/or store statistics.

Game and Player are both related to whatever game is implemented on top of this framework.




The JSON in Java [package org.json] package by Douglas Crockford (douglas@crockford.com) is being used currently (with the restriction "The software shall be used for good, 
not evil.")


JSON API Structure:

-{ID:<gameID>,COMMAND:[<commandName>,<arg1>,<arg2>,etc...]}
